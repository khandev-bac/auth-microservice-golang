Sure! Here's a cleaner version of the `README.md` with the requested focus and no file structure section:

# üîê Auth Microservice

This is an **Authentication Microservice** built in **Golang**, leveraging **JWT** for secure, stateless authentication. It integrates with **Firebase** for identity verification, uses **Apache Kafka** for event-driven communication, and **Redis** for caching and session/token management. The service is fully containerized with **Docker** to support scalable and portable deployment in modern cloud environments.

The microservice handles core authentication flows such as user registration, login, token generation (access and refresh tokens), and token verification. It publishes authentication-related events to Kafka topics for consumption by other services in a distributed system. Redis is used to store session data or token blacklists for quick access and enhanced performance. Firebase allows for secure and scalable user identity management, especially useful for integrating with mobile or third-party auth providers.

This setup is ideal for a microservices architecture where centralized authentication is needed across multiple services.

## üß± Tech Stack

* **Language:** Go (Golang)
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* **Identity Provider:** Firebase
* **Message Broker:** Apache Kafka
* **Caching/Session Store:** Redis
* **Containerization:** Docker

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Run

1. **Clone the repo**
2. **Create a `.env` file** with configs like `JWT_SECRET`, Firebase credentials, Redis URL, Kafka broker address, etc.
3. **Run with Docker Compose** or build manually:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## üì° Key Endpoints

* `POST /register` ‚Äì User registration
* `POST /login` ‚Äì User login & token generation
* `GET /verify-token` ‚Äì Verify access token
* `POST /refresh-token` ‚Äì Refresh tokens

## üì¶ Kafka Topics

* `auth.user.registered`
* `auth.user.logged_in`
